#### Description:

Introduction
---------------
Shiokz is an online marketplace where sellers and buyers can interact. Sellers can list their products while buyers can view available products in the marketplace. If buyers are interested in any of the products, they may contact the seller via email. Shiokz is created using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Flask, Jinja and SQL database.


Starting
---------------
A first-time user will need to register an account to use the marketplace. He or she will be prompted to provide a username, password, password confirmation, first name, last name, email and contact number. The user will be prompted for corrections if passwords don't match, there are missing fields or if the username has been used.

Features (Homepage)
---------------
Once user has successfully registered, user will be redirected to login page. After logging in, user will be directed to the homepage. The homepage lists the available products listed by all sellers. A table provides information on the date and time the product was listed, seller's username, product, product description, price and meetup location. The table's entries is provided using a database.

Features (Buying)
---------------
If buyer is interested in a product, buyer may contact the user via email by clicking on the seller's username in the homepage. Buyer will be directed to the computer's email client, with the seller's email information and subject heading customised.

Features (Selling)
---------------
User may list a product by clicking on 'Sell' button at the top. User will be prompted to fill in the relevant information such as the product, its description, price and meetup location. After user has submitted the form, the product will be listed on the marketplace, with its entry at the top. The most recent product listed will be displayed at the top of the marketplace.

Features (Update profile)
---------------
Users may update their profile by clicking on their username (button at top right). Users can update their passwords, contact and email address. Users will be informed if they are successful in updating.

Features (Update item status)
---------------
Sellers may update the item status if they have been sold by clicking on a checkbox and submitting it. Once updated, the item type will change form 'available' to 'sold' and it will be removed from the marketplace. This way, users will have a log history of items which have been sold.

Conclusion
---------------
Overall, this project has been very exciting. It has allowed me to implement interesting features for the marketplace and allowed me to learn web development independently. There are definitely enhancements which can be made, for example, using chat app and allowing uploads of images. The site can be made more appealing to users as well. I have enjoyed the course and final project thoroughly and I look forward to learning more web development skills in future.
